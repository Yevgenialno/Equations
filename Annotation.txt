The course work is an example of software implementation of a universal method for solving a system of equations with one unknown in the algebra of sets.
To implement the algorithm, a mathematical model of representation of the equation in the form of a ternary tree was used.
The C ++ programming language was chosen to implement the method.
The main menu interface was made using the "windows.h" library. and elements of pseudography.
The product of the course work is intended for educational purposes.
This product helps in the study of such a section of discrete mathematics as "set theory".
The software product can be useful primarily for first-year students of technical specialties.
